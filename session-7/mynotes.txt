         response
        <-------

Client starts the communication.
They will be running in:
    Computer
    mobile phone
    tablet
And in a computer can exist one or more clients and also one or more servers
Also a computer can be as the client and the server.

WHAT HAPPEN IF YOU DO NOT HAVE THE CLIENT?
    -Nothing, the server will be waiting for a client
WHAT HAPPEN IF YOU DO NOT HAVE THE SERVER?
    -It would be an error.

CLIENT AND SERVER are connected through INTERNET
Also there are isolated computers that are connected to each other that form a NETWORK. Here we have first to identify the machine to contact with it, for that we will
have to know the IP of the machine
It does not matter where you connect you arrive at the final point.

MY PHONE IP IS : 10.0.55.110
MY COMPUTER IP IS: 212.128.253.104

PING (IP): for knowing if the computer is alive. All the machines should answer to the ping question. If the machine exists there will be answers all
the time (probabbly a loop), with the information of the distance in internet with that machine in ms  and you exit that loop with CONTROL+C.
